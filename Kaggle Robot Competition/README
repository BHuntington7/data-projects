My Performance: Ranked 156/1478

This is the code I used to compete in Kaggle's competition, "CareerCon 2019 - Help Navigate Robots". This project is a classification
problem using time series data from acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity sensors on a robot to predict what kind of surface
the robot is maneuvering on (eg concrete, carpet, tile etc.). For feature selection, I used a library called tsfresh which you can find
here: https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

An academic paper by B.D. Fulcher that inspired this strategy can be found here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3531
