The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can identify questions that are similar from the AskUbuntu data
set. This is done using word embeddings and a convolutional neural network along with a cosine similarity criteria to identify such pairs.

This project has two python files. The first, vectorparser.py, is pre-processing script that gets the pre-trained word embedding vectors 
ready for use in the embedding layer of the neural network.

The second python script, embedding_corrected, builds the neural network, trains the neural network, and then saves the learned weights
to a file.
