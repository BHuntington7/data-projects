House Pricing Project based on data from Kaggle

This project focuses on data cleaning, label encoding, and machine learning models for predicting the price of houses. A random forest
model is trained and optimal hyper-parameters are found. Predictions are then made using this model and the results give an error of 0.14359
on the test set.
